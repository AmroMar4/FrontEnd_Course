    <h1> Task 3 using CSS </h1>
    <p> 
        Morning light spilled across quiet streets as birds argued on wires, coffee steamed nearby, 
        and a forgotten notebook waited patiently, holding plans, doubts, sketches, and hopeful
         ideas for tomorrow, while distant traffic hummed softly, leaves shifted in warm air,
          and a single clock ticked, reminding everyone time keeps moving forward steadily,
           without pause, through moments both ordinary and meaningful days.
